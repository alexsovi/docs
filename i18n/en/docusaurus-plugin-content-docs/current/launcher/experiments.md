# Experimental features
:::info
Experiments are only available in Legacy Launcher 160.0 or newer
:::

## What is it? {#what}
**Experiments** are potentially unstable features that we are not ready to enable for all users by default

## How to enable? {#enable}
1. Close Legacy Launcher
2. Open the Legacy Launcher configuration file with any text editor (e.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)).
    :::tip[Where can I find the Legacy Launcher configuration file?]
    Most often it will be located either in the `.tlauncher/legacy.properties` folder, or in the `tl.properties` file in the launcher install (e.g. `.tlauncher/legacy/Minecraft/tl.properties`)
    :::
3. Find the `experiments.available` line in the opened file - this is the list of available experiments
4. Find the `experiments.enabled` line in the opened file and write there the list of required experiments via `;`
    ```properties title="legacy.properties"
    # Available experiments list
    experiments.available=zgc;zgc_generational;shenandoah;tenuring;max_xms;updated_lwjgl;updated_jna
    # "none" will disable all experiments
    experiments.enabled=none
    # Example to enable "updated_lwjgl" and "updated_jna" experiments
    experiments.enabled=updated_lwjgl;updated_jna
    ```
5. Start Legacy Launcher

## Experiments list {#list}
:::note
`zgc`, `zgc_generational`, `shenandoah`, `tenuring` and `max_xms` experiments require "optimized arguments" feature
:::
* `zgc` - replaces CMS/G1 in the "optimized arguments" with ZGC. This garbage collector is quite efficient, but requires a very powerful CPU. ZGC was automatically enabled in older versions of LL on powerful PCs. Requires Java 15 or newer.
* `zgc_generational` - enables "generations" support in ZGC, which should improve its performance. Requires Java 21 or newer and a `zgc` experiment.
* `shenandoah` - replaces CMS/G1/ZGC in "optimized arguments" with Shenandoah. This garbage collector should be best suited for Minecraft, as it claims to provide the shortest possible RAM cleanup time. Requires Java 11 or newer.
* `tenuring` - Changes the MaxTenuringThreshold parameter of the garbage collector so that quickly aging data in game memory is "aged" slower and cleared faster. Should reduce the stutters duration during memory cleanup. *When using G1, these parameters are applied by default, the experiment enables this feature for other garbage collectors*.
* `max_xms` - allocates the entire selected RAM amount at the game startup.
* `updated_lwjgl` - Forcibly updates LWJGL on versions using LWJGL3 to 3.3.2. **Recommended for solving Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/...) issues**.
* `updated_jna` - Forcibly updates JNA on versions that use it to 5.13.0. **Recommended for solving macOS issues**.
