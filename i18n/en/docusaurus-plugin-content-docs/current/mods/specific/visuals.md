# "Visuals" and other similar mods from their creators

:::danger[Note!]
Often, "visuals" are written extremely badly, functions are simply cut out of the cheats. These mods can have a crazy amount of unreadable code and protection through DLL with VMProtect, which logically confirms the presence of bad code and viruses. We in no way support their use and do not recommend them to buy!
:::

::tip
Modrinth and CurseForge usually have normal analogs of Viewmodel and other functions from "visuals"
